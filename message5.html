                        ZAEEM MITHA. THE MAN. THE MYTH. THE LEGEND. HAPPY 18TH BIRTHDAY. 
                        Man where do I even begin. Okay so way back you were friends with Sahil, and 
                        I just remember not liking you for some reason. 
                        Not hating you, but I never talked even tho we hung out with kinda the same people. 
                        Then... what I like to call the big bang event... Fortnite and BUI. 
                        I actually got to talk with you, and find out I didn't wanna be your frien-. Shit wrong script my bad one second.
                        Okay here we go. I found out I wanted to be your friend because you were actually a cool guy, who basically could make anyone laugh on command 
                        (that's not even cap). And as time went on and this group got formed, we got closer and closer. 
                        I mean starting with just being chill and talking, to loving Still Woozy and basketball, its been a dope ride with you babe. 
                        Even tho we gonna be away soon at uni, I'll still give you goodnight smooches.
                        </br></br>
                         Hope you enjoy your birthday!!!!
